## Development

This project uses SASS for styling. To work with the project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory. Then, run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile SASS:**

   This project uses Gulp to compile SASS into CSS. To compile the `scss` files, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   gulp
   ```

   This will compile the `scss/styles.scss` file and output the CSS to `css/styles.css`.
